# Discord Integration Refactor Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified `/init` Command
- **Before**: Had a confusing `clear` option with complex logic
- **After**: Single purpose command that completely rebuilds Discord channels from Toji projects
- **Behavior**:
  - Deletes ALL channels in the "Toji Desktop" category
  - Rebuilds from scratch using current Toji projects (`getAvailableProjects()`)
  - Simple and predictable behavior

### 2. Removed `/refresh` Command
- **Reason**: Redundant and complex sync logic that often failed
- **Files Removed**:
  - `src/plugins/discord/commands/refresh.ts`
  - Updated command registration in `deploy-commands.ts` and `SlashCommandModule.ts`

### 3. Simplified `/project` Command
- **Removed**: `import` subcommand (was complex and unreliable)
- **Kept**: `list`, `current`, `switch`, `add`, `remove` subcommands
- **Rationale**: Import functionality now handled by `/init` command

### 4. Enhanced CategoryManager
- **Added**: `deleteAllProjectChannels()` method for clean rebuilds
- **Purpose**: Provides reliable way to completely clear Discord channels

### 5. Simplified DiscordProjectManager
- **Removed**:
  - Complex `syncWithDiscord()` logic
  - Auto-import functionality that ran on startup
  - `autoImportTojiProjects()` method
- **Simplified**: `loadAndSyncState()` now just loads state without complex sync logic
- **Improved**: `initializeChannels()` now properly rebuilds from Toji projects

### 6. Updated Help Documentation
- **Updated**: Help text to reflect new simplified `/init` behavior
- **Removed**: References to deprecated `/refresh` command

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Predictable Behavior**
- `/init` does exactly one thing: complete rebuild
- No more confusing sync states or partial operations

### 2. **Reduced Complexity**
- Eliminated complex state synchronization logic
- Removed auto-import that could surprise users
- Single source of truth: Toji projects via `getAvailableProjects()`

### 3. **Better Error Handling**
- Simple operations are less likely to fail
- When they do fail, easier to understand and debug

### 4. **Cleaner Architecture**
- Separation of concerns:
  - CategoryManager handles Discord channel operations
  - DiscordProjectManager handles state and mapping
  - Commands handle user interactions

## Usage After Refactor

### For Users:
1. **Setup/Reset**: Use `/init` to rebuild all channels from Toji projects
2. **Project Management**: Use `/project add`, `/project remove`, etc. for individual projects
3. **No More Confusion**: No need to understand complex sync states

### For Developers:
1. **Simpler Logic**: Fewer edge cases to handle
2. **Clear Entry Points**: `/init` for rebuilds, individual project commands for management
3. **Easier Debugging**: Less complex state to reason about

## Remaining Commands

### `/init`
- **Purpose**: Complete rebuild of Discord channels from Toji projects
- **Usage**: Just run `/init` - no options needed
- **Effect**: Deletes all channels in "Toji Desktop" category, recreates from current Toji projects

### `/project list`
- **Purpose**: Show all Discord project channels
- **Shows**: Project name, path, Discord channel link

### `/project add <path> [name]`
- **Purpose**: Add a single project manually
- **Effect**: Creates Discord channel and switches to project

### `/project remove <name>`
- **Purpose**: Remove a project and its Discord channel
- **Effect**: Deletes channel and removes from state

### `/project switch <name>`
- **Purpose**: Switch to a different project
- **Effect**: Changes Toji's working directory to that project

### `/project current`
- **Purpose**: Show currently active project
- **Shows**: Both Discord active project and Toji working directory

## Files Modified

1. `src/plugins/discord/commands/init.ts` - Simplified to single-purpose rebuild
2. `src/plugins/discord/commands/project.ts` - Removed import subcommand
3. `src/plugins/discord/commands/help.ts` - Updated help text
4. `src/plugins/discord/modules/CategoryManager.ts` - Added deleteAllProjectChannels()
5. `src/plugins/discord/modules/DiscordProjectManager.ts` - Simplified state management
6. `src/plugins/discord/deploy-commands.ts` - Removed refresh command registration
7. `src/plugins/discord/modules/SlashCommandModule.ts` - Removed refresh command registration

## Files Removed

1. `src/plugins/discord/commands/refresh.ts` - No longer needed

This refactor significantly simplifies the Discord integration while maintaining all essential functionality. The single `/init` command now provides a reliable way to reset and rebuild the Discord channel structure from the current Toji projects.
