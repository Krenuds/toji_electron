  The problem:
  We have 3 distinct concepts that have a lot of overlap, and are getting a bit
  confused. These concepts are A: Workspaces, B: Projects and C: Sessions. Your
  job now is to crawl the opencode.ai documentation and tell me the difference
  between the 3 according to the opencode SDK

● I'll research the OpenCode documentation to clarify the distinctions between
   Workspaces, Projects, and Sessions according to the OpenCode SDK.

● Fetch(https://opencode.ai/docs)
  ⎿  Received 81.8KB (200 OK)

● Let me search for more specific documentation about these concepts:

● Web Search("OpenCode SDK workspace project session concepts documentation")
  ⎿  Did 1 search in 31s

● Let me fetch more specific information from the OpenCode GitHub repository:

● Fetch(https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode)
  ⎿  Received 496.7KB (200 OK)

● Let me check the SDK documentation directly:

● Fetch(https://opencode.ai/docs/sdk)
  ⎿  Received 86.3KB (200 OK)

● Now let me look at the actual SDK implementation in our codebase to see how
  these are defined:

● Bash(grep -r "interface.*Project" src/main/api --include="*.ts" | head -10)
  ⎿  src/main/api/types.ts:export interface DiscoveredProject {
     src/main/api/types.ts:export interface EnrichedProject {

● Read(node_modules\@opencode-ai\sdk\dist\index.d.ts)
  ⎿  Read 3 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Let me check the client types:

● Bash(find node_modules/@opencode-ai/sdk/dist -name "*.d.ts" -exec grep -l
      "Project\|Session\|Workspace" {} \;)
  ⎿  node_modules/@opencode-ai/sdk/dist/gen/sdk.gen.d.ts
     node_modules/@opencode-ai/sdk/dist/gen/types.gen.d.ts

● Bash(grep -A 5 "export type Project"
      node_modules/@opencode-ai/sdk/dist/gen/types.gen.d.ts)
  ⎿  export type Project = {
         id: string;
         worktree: string;
     … +39 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Bash(grep -A 10 "export type Session"
      node_modules/@opencode-ai/sdk/dist/gen/types.gen.d.ts | head -30)
  ⎿  export type Session = {
         id: string;
         projectID: string;
     … +28 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Excellent! Now I have the actual OpenCode SDK type definitions. Let me also
  check for workspace/path definitions:

● Bash(grep -B 2 -A 5 "worktree"
      node_modules/@opencode-ai/sdk/dist/gen/types.gen.d.ts | head -20)
  ⎿  export type Project = {
         id: string;
         worktree: string;
     … +14 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now let me summarize my findings based on the actual OpenCode SDK type
  definitions:

  OpenCode SDK Concept Clarification

  Based on the actual OpenCode SDK type definitions, here are the three
  distinct concepts:

  1. Projects (OpenCode Projects)

  type Project = {
      id: string;
      worktree: string;  // Git worktree path
      vcs?: "git";       // Version control system
      time: {
          created: number;
          initialized?: number;
      };
  }
  - What it is: A Git worktree-based entity managed by OpenCode
  - Key identifier: Has a unique id and is tied to a worktree (Git worktree
  path)
  - Scope: Represents a versioned codebase with Git
  - Persistence: Stored and managed by OpenCode SDK

  2. Sessions (OpenCode Sessions)

  type Session = {
      id: string;
      projectID: string;    // Links to a Project
      directory: string;    // Working directory for this session
      parentID?: string;    // For branched sessions
      title: string;
      version: string;
      time: {
          created: number;
          updated?: number;
      };
  }
  - What it is: An AI conversation/interaction context
  - Relationship: Each session belongs to a Project (projectID)
  - Key features:
    - Has conversation history
    - Can be shared
    - Can have parent sessions (branching)
    - Has a specific working directory
  - Purpose: Tracks AI interactions, prompts, and responses

  3. Workspaces (Toji3 Concept - NOT OpenCode)

  In our Toji3 application, we've been using "Workspace" to mean:
  - What it is: A working directory where development happens
  - Not an OpenCode concept: This is our application's terminology
  - Actual OpenCode equivalent: The directory field in Sessions or the current
   working path

  The Hierarchy and Relationships

  Git Repository (with .git)
      ↓
  OpenCode Project (worktree-based)
      ↓
  Multiple Sessions (conversations within that project)
      ↓
  Each Session has a directory (working context)

  The Confusion We Need to Fix

  1. We're calling working directories "Workspaces" - but OpenCode doesn't
  have this concept
  2. OpenCode Projects are Git worktree-based - not just any directory
  3. Sessions are conversation contexts - not work areas

  Recommendations

  1. Rename our "Workspaces" to "Directories" or "Work Folders" to avoid
  confusion
  2. Keep "OpenCode Projects" as the proper term for Git worktree entities
  3. Keep "Sessions" for AI conversation contexts
  4. Make it clear that:
    - Opening a folder = Setting working directory
    - OpenCode Project = Git-based project entity
    - Session = AI chat conversation with history

  This aligns with the OpenCode SDK's actual data model and prevents confusion
   between our app concepts and OpenCode's concepts.

> is every project a git worktree? I'm wondering if we can just use projects all
   around instead of workspaces. but I'm not sure. Are they the same thing? Is a
   project a directory, with extra git worktree stuff? I don't understand how
  they work. Our current implementation is using "workspaces" but is that just a
   project without the git worktree?

● Let me research this more deeply to understand how OpenCode Projects
  actually work and whether they're just directories or specifically Git
  worktrees.

● Bash(grep -B 5 -A 10 "worktree" src/main/api/opencode-project/manager.ts)
  ⎿        console.log('=== Project Information ===')
           console.log(`Current project: ${current?.id || 'None'}`)
           console.log(`Total projects: ${projects.data.length}`)
     … +9 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Web Search("git worktree explained what is a git worktree vs regular git
            repository")
  ⎿  Did 0 searches in 4s

> The real question that we're trying to answer is "Do we need 3 things?"
  Projects, workspaces (directories) and sessions?

● Great question! Let me analyze whether we actually need all three concepts
  by examining what each one does in our current implementation.

● Read(src\main\api\toji.ts)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Bash(grep -A 10 "changeWorkspace" src/main/api/toji.ts)
  ⎿    async changeWorkspace(directory: string): Promise<{
         isNew: boolean
         hasGit: boolean
     … +8 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Let me check what happens when we list projects:

● Bash(grep -B 5 -A 15 "list()" src/main/api/opencode-project/manager.ts)
  ⎿    constructor(private clientManager: ClientManager) {}

       /**
     … +64 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now let me understand the relationship better by checking how OpenCode
  actually works:

● Bash(cd C:/Users/donth/toji3 && npx opencode project list 2>&1 | head -20)
  ⎿  █▀▀█ █▀▀█ █▀▀ █▀▀▄ █▀▀ █▀▀█ █▀▀▄ █▀▀

     ▀▀▀▀ █▀▀▀ ▀▀▀ ▀  ▀ ▀▀▀ ▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀  ▀▀▀
     … +19 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Let me check what OpenCode considers as projects in our test directory:

● Bash(cd C:/Users/donth/OneDrive/Desktop/tojiTest && dir)
  ⎿  AGENTS.md  opencode.json  test.md  test.txt

● Bash(cd C:/Users/donth/OneDrive/Desktop/tojiTest && git status 2>&1)
  ⎿  On branch master
     Untracked files:
       (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
     … +4 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now let me check how many directories we have that are git repos vs non-git:

● Bash(cd C:/Users/donth && find . -maxdepth 3 -type d -name ".git" 2>/dev/null |
      wc -l)
  ⎿  4

● Let me check what OpenCode actually stores about projects:

● Bash(dir C:\Users\donth\AppData\Roaming\toji3\opencode-data\opencode\state 2>&1)
  ⎿  Error: dir: cannot access
     'C:UsersdonthAppDataRoamingtoji3opencode-dataopencodestate': No such file or

     … +5 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now I understand! Let me check one more thing - can we work in a non-git
  directory:

● Bash(mkdir -p /tmp/test-non-git && cd /tmp/test-non-git && echo "test" >
      test.txt && ls -la)
  ⎿  total 3841
     drwxr-xr-x 1 donth 197609 0 Sep 19 00:29 .

     -rw-r--r-- 1 donth 197609 5 Sep 19 00:29 test.txt

● Based on my research, here's what I've discovered about OpenCode's
  architecture and whether we need all three concepts:

  The Reality of OpenCode's Architecture

  1. OpenCode Projects ARE Tied to Git

  - Every project (except "global") has a worktree path and vcs: "git" flag
  - Projects are stored with SHA-1 hashes as IDs (Git commit-like)
  - The "global" project is a special case with worktree: "/"

  2. OpenCode CAN Work Without Git

  - OpenCode can start in any directory (git or non-git)
  - When in a non-git directory, it uses the "global" project
  - Sessions can be created in any directory

  3. The Three Concepts Serve Different Purposes

  - Directory/Workspace: Where you're currently working (any folder)
  - Project: OpenCode's way of tracking Git repositories it has seen
  - Session: Conversation history within a context

  Do We Need All Three?

  Short answer: No, we can simplify to just TWO concepts.

  Here's my analysis:

  Current Confusion:

  - We're calling directories "workspaces"
  - OpenCode calls git repos "projects"
  - Users just want to open folders and chat

  The Problem:

  - Not every directory is a git repo
  - OpenCode creates projects only for git repos
  - But OpenCode works fine in non-git directories (uses global project)
