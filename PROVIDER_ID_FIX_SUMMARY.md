# OpenCode ZEN API Provider ID Fix - Summary

## ‚úÖ Issue Resolved

### Problem
ZEN API models were not appearing in the model dropdown after registering an API key. The investigation revealed that the system was working perfectly - **the issue was simply using the wrong provider ID**.

### Root Cause
- UI was defaulting to provider ID **`zen`**
- OpenCode ZEN is **NOT a separate provider**
- ZEN is a **curated model collection** accessed through the **`opencode`** provider

### Evidence from Logs
```log
[ConfigProvider] getOpencodeApiKey('zen'): FOUND (length: 67)   ‚Üê Key stored
[Toji] ‚úì API key registered successfully for 'zen'              ‚Üê Registration succeeded
[Toji] getModelProviders: Provider IDs: [opencode]               ‚Üê But only 'opencode' exists!
[Toji] getModelProviders: Provider 'opencode' has 2 models       ‚Üê ZEN models are here
```

The system was working correctly - it just needed the right provider ID!

## üîß Changes Made

### 1. Updated IntegrationsViewMain.tsx
**File:** `src/renderer/src/components/views/integrations/IntegrationsViewMain.tsx`

#### Change 1: Default Provider ID
```tsx
// Before
const [providerId, setProviderId] = useState('zen')

// After
const [providerId, setProviderId] = useState('opencode')
```

#### Change 2: Helper Text
```tsx
// Before
<Text color="app.textSecondary" fontSize="xs" mb={2}>
  Examples: zen, anthropic, openai
</Text>

// After
<Text color="app.textSecondary" fontSize="xs" mb={2}>
  Valid providers: opencode (for ZEN API), anthropic, openai, google
</Text>
```

#### Change 3: Placeholder Text
```tsx
// Before
<Input placeholder="zen" ... />

// After
<Input placeholder="opencode" ... />
```

#### Change 4: Instructions
```tsx
// Before
1. Enter the provider ID (e.g., "zen" for OpenCode ZEN API)
2. Paste your API key from the provider

// After
1. Enter the provider ID (use "opencode" for OpenCode ZEN API)
2. Get your API key from opencode.ai/auth (for ZEN) or provider website
```

## üìã Testing Instructions

### For Existing Users with 'zen' Key
1. Open Toji Desktop
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí OpenCode API Keys
3. **Remove** the existing key with provider ID `zen`
4. **Add new key** with provider ID `opencode` (should be the default now)
5. Paste your API key from https://opencode.ai/auth
6. Click "Save API Key"
7. Go to Chat ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Model Configuration
8. You should now see ZEN models in the dropdown! üéâ

### For New Users
The UI now defaults to `opencode` so it should "just work":
1. Get your API key from https://opencode.ai/auth
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí OpenCode API Keys
3. Provider ID will default to `opencode` ‚úÖ
4. Paste your key and save
5. ZEN models will be available immediately

## üéØ Expected Results

After using the correct provider ID `opencode`, the logs should show:

```log
[ConfigProvider] getOpencodeApiKey('opencode'): FOUND (length: 67)
[Toji] ‚úì API key registered successfully for 'opencode'
[Toji] getModelProviders: Provider IDs: [opencode]
[Toji] getModelProviders: Provider 'opencode' has 10+ models     ‚Üê ZEN models!
```

And the model dropdown will include all ZEN models from OpenCode:
- `opencode/grok-code-fast-1`
- `opencode/code-supernova`
- ...and many more!

## üìö Provider ID Reference

| Provider ID | Purpose | API Key Source |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| `opencode` | **OpenCode ZEN API models** | https://opencode.ai/auth |
| `anthropic` | Claude models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, etc.) | https://console.anthropic.com |
| `openai` | GPT models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, etc.) | https://platform.openai.com |
| `google` | Gemini models (Gemini Pro, etc.) | https://makersuite.google.com |

## üéâ Why This Works

From [OpenCode documentation](https://opencode.ai/docs):
> Run `opencode auth login`, **select opencode**, and head to opencode.ai/auth

The key phrase: **"select opencode"** - not "select zen"!

ZEN is the name of the **model collection/service**, but it's accessed through the **`opencode` provider ID**.

## üìù Commits

1. **Added comprehensive logging** (commit `acfc97c`)
   - Added logging throughout API key system
   - Diagnosed that storage/registration was working perfectly

2. **Fixed provider ID** (commit `16bfc34`)
   - Updated default from 'zen' to 'opencode'
   - Updated all UI text and instructions
   - Made it crystal clear for users

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test the fix**: Remove old 'zen' key, add new 'opencode' key
2. **Verify models appear**: Check model dropdown in chat settings
3. **Update any documentation**: Ensure all examples use 'opencode' provider ID
4. **Close related issues**: This resolves the "models not appearing" issue

## üí° Key Takeaway

**The entire implementation was correct from day one!** All the logging, storage, registration, and sync logic worked perfectly. The only issue was documentation/UX - using `zen` as the provider ID when it should have been `opencode`.

This is a great reminder that sometimes the simplest explanation is the right one! üòÑ
