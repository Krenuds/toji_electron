# Permission System Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

A simple, role-based permission system for the Discord bot with two access levels:

1. **Server Owner** - Automatic full access (no configuration needed)
2. **Toji Admin Role** - Full access for members with this role

## Files Created

### `/src/plugins/discord/utils/permissions.ts`

- Core permission checking logic
- `hasPermission()` - Main permission validation function
- `getPermissionDescription()` - User-friendly permission descriptions
- `adminRoleExists()` - Helper to check if admin role exists

### `/src/plugins/discord/PERMISSIONS.md`

- Complete setup guide for server owners
- Troubleshooting steps
- Security considerations

## Files Modified

### `/src/plugins/discord/constants.ts`

- Added `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE_NAME = 'Toji Admin'`
- Added `PERMISSION_MESSAGES` for consistent error messaging

### `/src/plugins/discord/modules/SlashCommandModule.ts`

- Added permission check before command execution
- Returns user-friendly access denied embed with role info
- Logs permission denials for debugging

### `/src/plugins/discord/commands/help.ts`

- Added permissions section to help embed
- Shows who can use commands

## How It Works

1. **User executes a command** (e.g., `/init`)
2. **SlashCommandModule intercepts** the interaction
3. **Permission check runs:**
   - Is user the server owner? ‚Üí ‚úÖ Allow
   - Does user have "Toji Admin" role? ‚Üí ‚úÖ Allow
   - Neither? ‚Üí ‚ùå Deny with helpful error message
4. **If allowed:** Command executes normally
5. **If denied:** User sees embed explaining requirements

## Access Denied Message

When a user lacks permission, they see:

```
üö´ Access Denied
You don't have permission to use this command.

üë• Who Can Use Commands
‚Ä¢ Server Owner (automatic access)
‚Ä¢ Members with the Toji Admin role

Contact your server owner to get access
```

## Testing Steps

1. **As Server Owner:**
   - Run any command (e.g., `/help`) ‚Üí Should work
2. **As Regular User (no role):**
   - Run any command ‚Üí Should see "Access Denied"
3. **Create "Toji Admin" role:**
   - Server Settings ‚Üí Roles ‚Üí Create Role
   - Name: `Toji Admin`
4. **Assign role to test user:**
   - Right-click user ‚Üí Roles ‚Üí Check "Toji Admin"
5. **As user with role:**
   - Run any command ‚Üí Should work

## Security Benefits

- **Prevents unauthorized access** - Random server members can't use bot
- **Simple administration** - Just assign a role
- **No database needed** - Uses Discord's native role system
- **Server owner always has access** - Can't lock yourself out
- **Clear messaging** - Users know why they can't use commands

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

- Multiple permission tiers (read-only vs. full access)
- Per-command permission levels
- Configurable role name via config
- `/admin` commands for role management
- Permission audit logging
- Temporary permission grants

## Code Quality

‚úÖ All files pass TypeScript compilation
‚úÖ All files pass ESLint
‚úÖ All files formatted with Prettier
‚úÖ Follows project architecture (thin IPC handlers)
‚úÖ Includes comprehensive logging
‚úÖ Type-safe throughout

## Migration Impact

- **No breaking changes** - Existing functionality preserved
- **Opt-in security** - Server owners need to create role
- **Server owner unaffected** - Still has automatic access
- **Clear error messages** - Users understand why commands fail

## Configuration

Currently hardcoded to `"Toji Admin"` role name. Can be made configurable by:

1. Adding to main process config
2. Passing via DiscordPlugin constructor
3. Adding `/admin config` command

## Commit Message

```
feat(discord): add role-based permission system

- Add permission checking for all slash commands
- Server owner gets automatic full access
- "Toji Admin" role grants full command access
- Add user-friendly access denied messages
- Include permissions info in /help command
- Add setup guide for server owners

Follows simple MVP approach - two access levels only.
Future enhancements can add granular permissions.
```
