# Discord Plugin Refactoring ✅ COMPLETED

## Refactoring Summary (2025-09-18)

Successfully refactored Discord integration to use a plugin architecture:

1. **DiscordService** (src/main/services/discord-service.ts) - Now minimal:
   - ✅ Bot connection management only
   - ✅ Token management via ConfigProvider
   - ✅ Emits events to plugin
   - ✅ No business logic (moved to plugin)

2. **Discord Plugin** (src/plugins/discord/) - Now fully implemented:
   - ✅ DiscordPlugin.ts - Main plugin orchestrator
   - ✅ modules/ChatModule.ts - Chat handling with sessions
   - ✅ modules/CommandModule.ts - Command processing

# Workspace-First UI Implementation ✅ COMPLETED (2025-09-19)

## What We Accomplished

Successfully transformed the UI from session-centric to workspace-centric architecture:

### Core Changes

1. **API Layer** - Added `getWorkspacesFromSessions()` method to extract workspaces from sessions
2. **Frontend Architecture** - Complete workspace-first redesign
3. **File Browser Integration** - Replaced modal with native file explorer

### Components Created

- `WorkspaceCard` - Clean card UI for workspace display
- `useWorkspaces` - Hook for workspace data management
- Browse Sessions now opens file explorer instead of modal

### UI Improvements

- Workspaces are primary, sessions are secondary
- Removed duplicate Browse Sessions/Refresh buttons
- Fixed modal rendering conflicts
- Cleaner, more intuitive interface

# Next Steps: ConfigManager Integration

## Current State

We've successfully implemented a workspace-first UI architecture where:

- Workspaces (folders) are the primary organizational unit
- Sessions are derived from workspace data
- UI is clean and focused on workspace management
- File browser integration replaces complex modals

## What Needs to Be Done

### 1. ConfigManager Integration

The ConfigManager needs to be properly wired up to support:

#### Workspace Preferences

- **Recent Workspaces**: Track and persist recently opened workspaces
- **Default Workspace**: Store user's preferred default workspace
- **Workspace Settings**: Per-workspace configuration (theme, preferences, etc.)

#### Implementation Tasks

- [ ] Update ConfigProvider to handle workspace-specific settings
- [ ] Add methods for managing recent workspaces list
- [ ] Implement workspace preference persistence
- [ ] Add workspace-specific configuration storage

### 2. Session Storage Configuration

- [ ] Define where sessions are actually stored (currently using working directory)
- [ ] Consider OpenCode data directory structure
- [ ] Implement proper session file management

### 3. UI Enhancements

- [ ] Add workspace sorting options (by name, last activity, session count)
- [ ] Implement workspace search/filter functionality
- [ ] Add workspace management features (rename, archive, delete)
- [ ] Consider workspace grouping/categories

### 4. Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Implement workspace data caching
- [ ] Add pagination for large workspace lists
- [ ] Optimize session counting queries

### 5. Error Handling & Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle workspaces with no sessions gracefully
- [ ] Deal with deleted/moved workspace directories
- [ ] Implement workspace migration when paths change

## Priority Order

1. **ConfigManager wiring** - Critical for persistence
2. **Recent workspaces tracking** - Core UX feature
3. **Session storage clarification** - Needed for Browse Sessions feature
4. **UI enhancements** - Polish and usability
5. **Performance & edge cases** - Robustness

## Notes

- Keep workspace concept separate from OpenCode "projects" (git worktrees)
- Maintain single source of truth (sessions drive workspace discovery)
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility for all file operations
- Consider backward compatibility with existing user data

# Previous Completed Work

## Directory Selection and Workspace Management ✅

- Set default working directory via ConfigProvider
- Added changeWorkspace method to Toji API
- Workspace identification using .toji.workspace tokens
- Session-workspace relationship established

## Toji API Implementation ✅

- Complete API folder structure created
- All managers implemented (Server, Client, Workspace, Session, Project)
- Full OpenCode SDK wrapped and accessible
- Clean dependency injection pattern established

## Architecture Vision Realized ✅

- **Toji API** = The platform brain
- **OpenCode SDK** = One orchestrated service
- **Multiple Interfaces** = All talk to Toji (Electron, Discord, future: Slack, CLI)
- **Clean Separation** = API/Services/Interfaces layers
