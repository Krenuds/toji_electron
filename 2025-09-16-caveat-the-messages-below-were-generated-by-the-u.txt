> read the latest git commit and then tail the logs a bit. Today we're going to figure out why, even when creating a new 
  session, opencode can't read files in a directory. You should examine the former, and then https://opencode.ai/docs/sdk/ read 
  up on the SDK. This may be a bug in our code, or it could just be behavioural.

● I'll help you investigate why OpenCode can't read files in a directory even with new sessions. Let me start by examining the
   latest git commit and then look at the logs.

● Bash(git log -1 --stat)
  ⎿  commit 5c766c35c377f8f06e265a5e862b891e2ac7c99a

● Now let me check the logs and look for any errors related to file reading:

● Bash(tail -n 50 ~/.local/share/opencode/log/opencode.log 2>/dev/null || echo "No OpenCode logs found")
  ⎿  Interrupted · What should Claude do instead?

> when I said tail the logs I mean opencode.log and NEXT.txt which was our last conversatin

● I'll read the OpenCode log and NEXT.txt to understand the previous conversation and the file reading issue.

● Read(NEXT.txt)
  ⎿  Error: File content (34667 tokens) exceeds maximum allowed tokens (25000). Please use offset and limit parameters to read 
     specific portions of the file, or use the GrepTool to search for specific content.

● Let me read the end of NEXT.txt to see the most recent conversation:

● Read(NEXT.txt)
  ⎿  Read 200 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now let me look at the OpenCode log file:

● Search(pattern: "**/*opencode*.log")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

● Let me check the OpenCode service to understand the current implementation:

● Read(src\main\services\opencode-service.ts)
  ⎿  Read 364 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now let me check the ConfigProvider to see what directory is configured:

● Read(src\main\config\ConfigProvider.ts)
  ⎿  Read 36 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now let me check the OpenCode SDK documentation to understand the file reading issue better:

● Fetch(https://opencode.ai/docs/sdk/)
  ⎿  Received 86.1KB (200 OK)

● Let me check the Core class to see how sessions are being created and used:

● Read(src\main\core\core.ts)
  ⎿  Read 217 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now let me check if there are any test files in the tojiTest directory that OpenCode should be able to read:

● Search(pattern: "**/*", path: "~\OneDrive\Desktop\tojiTest")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Let me check for recent errors in the NEXT.txt:

● Search(pattern: "ProviderModelNotFoundError|error|file|read|directory", path: "NEXT.txt", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 962 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Based on my investigation, I've identified the issue with OpenCode not being able to read files in directories. Let me
  research this more thoroughly by checking the OpenCode SDK documentation for file operations:

● Fetch(https://opencode.ai/docs/sdk/)
  ⎿  Received 86.1KB (200 OK)

● Now let me create a test to see if the file operations work with our current setup:

   │ │
  │ │   - Add searchText(query) for text search in files 
  What do these functions do? How are they used?

● Let me explain what these file operation functions would do and how they'd be used based on the OpenCode SDK:

  File Operation Functions Explained

  1. readFile(path) Method

  Purpose: Reads the contents of a specific file in the working directory

  SDK API Used: client.file.read({ query: { path: "relative/path/to/file" } })

  How it works:
  - Takes a file path relative to the session's working directory
  - Returns the file contents as text
  - Can read any file the OpenCode server has access to

  Example usage:
  // In Core class
  async readFile(filePath: string): Promise<string> {
    const response = await this.openCodeClient.file.read({
      query: { path: filePath }
    });
    return response.data.content; // Returns file contents
  }

  // Usage from renderer
  const content = await core.readFile("src/index.ts");
  console.log(content); // Prints the file contents

  2. findFiles(query) Method

  Purpose: Searches for files by name pattern (like glob matching)

  SDK API Used: client.find.files({ query: { query: "*.ts" } })

  How it works:
  - Takes a search pattern (supports wildcards like *.js, **/*.tsx)
  - Returns a list of file paths matching the pattern
  - Searches within the session's working directory

  Example usage:
  // In Core class
  async findFiles(pattern: string): Promise<string[]> {
    const response = await this.openCodeClient.find.files({
      query: { query: pattern }
    });
    return response.data.files; // Returns array of file paths
  }

  // Usage from renderer
  const tsFiles = await core.findFiles("**/*.ts");
  console.log(tsFiles); // ["src/index.ts", "src/utils.ts", ...]

  3. searchText(query) Method

  Purpose: Searches for text content within files (like grep)

  SDK API Used: client.find.text({ query: { query: "TODO" } })

  How it works:
  - Takes a text string to search for
  - Searches through all files in the working directory
  - Returns matches with file paths, line numbers, and context

  Example usage:
  // In Core class
  async searchText(searchTerm: string): Promise<TextMatch[]> {
    const response = await this.openCodeClient.find.text({
      query: { query: searchTerm }
    });
    return response.data.matches; // Returns matches with locations
  }

  // Usage from renderer
  const todos = await core.searchText("TODO");
  console.log(todos);
  // Returns: [
  //   { file: "src/index.ts", line: 42, text: "// TODO: implement feature" },
  //   { file: "src/utils.ts", line: 15, text: "// TODO: add error handling" }
  // ]

  Why These Are Needed

  Currently, your Core class only has a prompt() method for chat interactions. But OpenCode can do much more - it can:

  1. Navigate and read project files - Essential for AI to understand your codebase
  2. Search for patterns - Find all React components, all test files, etc.
  3. Search for text - Find all TODOs, find where a function is called, etc.

  Without these methods, the OpenCode session can't interact with files in the tojiTest directory, even though the server is
  running there. The session exists but has no way to access the file system through your Core API.

  The Real Problem

  Looking at the logs from NEXT.txt, when you create a session with:
  const sessionResponse = await this.openCodeClient!.session.create({
    body: {
      title: `Chat ${new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}`
    }
  })

  The session is created successfully (ses_6aafd32e1ffeqGj1V6XxFCg4mJ), but it doesn't have a working directory context. The
  session doesn't know it should be operating in C:\Users\donth\OneDrive\Desktop\tojiTest.

  This is why even though OpenCode server is running in the right directory, the session can't read files - it doesn't inherit
   the server's working directory automatically. You need to either:
  1. Set the path when creating the session
  2. Or configure the session's context after creation

  These file operation methods would use the properly configured session to actually access files in your target directory.

> read more int NEXT.txt. It created a file in the right directory, but why didnt it read it? I think we're getting close but 
  need to examine the SDK a little more. So are you saying that it is operating in the right folder, but it doesnt know it's 
  operating in the right folder?

● Let me read more from NEXT.txt to find where it created a file but couldn't read it:

● Search(pattern: "created|Created|wrote|Write|file.*AGENTS|AGENTS\.md|tojiTest", path: "NEXT.txt", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 311 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now let me read CONVO.md to see the actual interaction where it created but couldn't read the file:

● Search(pattern: "AGENTS\.md|you're a clown|what files are|directory is empty", path: "CONVO.md", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 175 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! Now I can see exactly what's happening. Let me look for when it couldn't see the file:

● Search(pattern: "The directory is empty|ses_6aadcaf52ffe9D5vnBDVIJRyYB", path: "CONVO.md", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 77 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Excellent! Now I can see the full picture. You're absolutely right - OpenCode IS operating in the right folder but doesn't 
  know it's operating in the right folder. Here's what's happening:

  The Paradox

  1. OpenCode server IS in the right directory:
    - The logs show "cwd": "C:\\Users\\donth\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\tojiTest"
    - OpenCode successfully created AGENTS.md in that directory
    - The file physically exists there (we verified with ls)
  2. But OpenCode thinks the directory is empty:
    - When asked "what files are in this directory", it responded "The directory is empty"
    - The AI agent's reasoning shows it got: "C:\\Users\\donth\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\tojiTest/" but no file listing

  The Root Cause

  Looking at the OpenCode agent's reasoning in line 666 of CONVO.md:
  "The tool returned: \"C:\\Users\\donth\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\tojiTest/\"\n\n
  ...It appears to be a directory location, but no files or contents are listed, suggesting it might be empty."

  The OpenCode agent tried to list files but got only the directory path back, not the actual file listing! This suggests:

  1. Session Context Issue: Each new session (ses_6aade017... created the file, ses_6aadcaf52... couldn't see it) starts fresh
   without persistent context
  2. Tool Execution Problem: The OpenCode agent's internal file listing tool (likely ls or similar) is returning just the
  path, not the actual directory contents
  3. Working Directory vs Session Directory: The server's working directory (process.chdir()) doesn't automatically become the
   session's working directory for file operations

  Why This Happens

  From the SDK documentation and behavior:
  - The OpenCode server runs in tojiTest directory (via process.chdir())
  - But sessions don't inherit this context automatically
  - The AI agent's tools operate relative to the session's context, not the server's working directory
  - Each prompt creates a NEW session with no memory of previous operations

  The Fix Needed

> Oh I see. So we started the server in our "working directory" but didnt point it to the right project. Look up the SDK 
  projects now. I think the user mistook the process location for the working location.

● Exactly! You've hit the nail on the head. Let me look up the OpenCode SDK documentation about projects:

● Fetch(https://opencode.ai/docs/sdk/)
  ⎿  Received 86.1KB (200 OK)

● Perfect! Now I see the issue clearly. Let me check how we're starting the OpenCode server to see if we're setting a project:

● Read(src\main\services\opencode-service.ts)
  ⎿  Read 10 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now I understand the complete picture! You're absolutely right:

  The Real Problem

  We changed the process working directory (process.chdir()) but never told OpenCode about the PROJECT location!

  Looking at the code:
  1. We do process.chdir(workingDirectory) in line 220 - this just changes where Node.js is running
  2. We create the server with only model configuration - no project path!
  3. OpenCode server starts but has no idea what project to work with

  What's Actually Happening

  - Process location: C:\Users\donth\OneDrive\Desktop\tojiTest (via process.chdir())
  - OpenCode project: Not set! (probably defaults to wherever the OpenCode binary thinks it should be)
  - Result: OpenCode can create files (because the process is in the right place) but can't read them (because the project
  context isn't set)

  The Solution We Need

  We need to tell OpenCode about the project directory when creating the server. Looking at the SDK, we should:

  1. Add project path to server config:
  this.server = await createOpencodeServer({
    hostname: this.config.hostname,
    port: this.config.port,
    timeout: this.config.timeout,
    config: {
      model: this.config.model,
      // We need to add project configuration here!
      // Something like: project: workingDirectory or cwd: workingDirectory
    }
  })

  2. Or use the project API after server starts:
  // After server starts, set the project
  const client = createOpencodeClient({...})
  // Use project API to set the working directory as the active project

  3. Ensure sessions inherit project context:
  - When creating sessions, they should automatically use the configured project
  - This would make file operations work correctly

  The user (you in the previous conversation) mistakenly thought process.chdir() would set OpenCode's working directory, but
  that only changes the Node.js process location. OpenCode needs its own project configuration to know where to operate!

  This is why OpenCode could write files (the Node process was in the right place) but couldn't see them (OpenCode's project
  context wasn't set to that directory).

> Ok so then lets do this. Where we were letting the opencode.exe spawn before? Does that even matter now? or does the project 
  path the only thing that matters? We should continue investigating on opencode.ai

● You're right - let's investigate further on opencode.ai to understand how the project path works and whether the spawn
  location matters:

● Web Search("opencode SDK createOpencodeServer project path configuration")
  ⎿  Did 1 search in 21s                                                                                                     

● Good info! Now let me dig deeper into the Config documentation:

  ⎿  Complete Analysis: OpenCode Directory Issue
     
     The Core Problem
     
     OpenCode can create files but can't see them because:
     1. Process location != Project location: We changed process.cwd() but OpenCode doesn't know its project is there
     2. Each session is isolated: New sessions don't inherit the server's working directory
     3. No project configuration: We're not telling OpenCode which project/directory to work with
     
     Key Findings
     
     - OpenCode looks for opencode.json in current directory or traverses up to Git root
     - The -c flag exists for CLI but not exposed in SDK's createOpencodeServer
     - OpenCode has strict working directory constraints for security
     - The spawn location (process.chdir()) affects where files are created but not where OpenCode thinks it's working
     
     The Fix Plan
     
     1. Remove process.chdir() approach
       - Stop changing Node's working directory
       - This only affects file creation, not OpenCode's project context
     2. Create opencode.json in target directory
       - Add C:\Users\donth\OneDrive\Desktop\tojiTest\opencode.json
       - This tells OpenCode "this is a project directory"
     3. Use project API to verify
       - After creating client, call client.project.current() to see what OpenCode thinks
       - Log the current project to debug
     4. Implement persistent sessions
       - Stop creating new session for each prompt
       - Store session ID and reuse it
       - This maintains context between operations
     5. Test spawn location theory
       - Try spawning OpenCode binary directly from target directory
       - Or pass environment variables to set working directory
     6. Add file operation methods
       - Implement file.read(), find.files() using the SDK
       - These will work once project context is correct
     
     Immediate Actions Needed
     
     1. Add opencode.json to tojiTest directory
     2. Add logging to see what project.current() returns
     3. Store and reuse sessions instead of creating new ones
     4. Remove or modify the process.chdir() approach
     
     This should resolve the "can create but can't read" paradox!

● Perfect! Let me start implementing the fix. First, let me update the todo list to track our progress:

● Now let's start by creating an opencode.json in the target directory:

● Write(~\OneDrive\Desktop\tojiTest\opencode.json)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to ..\OneDrive\Desktop\tojiTest\opencode.json
     {
       "model": "opencode/grok-code",
       "instructions": []
     }

● Now let's add project.current() logging to the Core class to see what OpenCode thinks is the current project:

● Read(src\main\core\core.ts)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! Let me add project debugging right after the client is initialized:

● Update(src\main\core\core.ts)
  ⎿  Updated src\main\core\core.ts with 13 additions                                              
       113    
       114        console.log(`Core: OpenCode client initialized for ${serverStatus.url}`)
       115    
       116 +      // Debug: Check what project OpenCode thinks it's working with
       117 +      try {
       118 +        console.log('Core: Checking current project...')
       119 +        const currentProject = await this.openCodeClient.project.current()
       120 +        console.log('Core: Current project:', JSON.stringify(currentProject, null, 2))
       121 +  
       122 +        console.log('Core: Listing all projects...')
       123 +        const allProjects = await this.openCodeClient.project.list()
       124 +        console.log('Core: All projects:', JSON.stringify(allProjects, null, 2))
       125 +      } catch (error) {
       126 +        console.error('Core: Project debugging failed:', error)
       127 +      }
       128 +  
       129        // Test if the client can connect
       130        try {
       131          console.log('Core: Testing client connectivity...')

● Now let's implement persistent session management. Let me look at the current session creation logic:

● Read(src\main\core\core.ts)
  ⎿  Read 15 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● I need to add a persistent session field to the Core class. Let me update it:

● Update(src\main\core\core.ts)
  ⎿  Updated src\main\core\core.ts with 1 addition          
       26      private services = new Map<string, Service>()
       27      private currentWorkspace?: string
       28      private openCodeClient?: OpencodeClient
       29 +    private currentSession?: Session
       30    
       31      constructor(private config: ConfigProvider) {
       32        // Config is available to core

● Now let me find the session creation logic and modify it to use persistent sessions:

● Read(src\main\core\core.ts)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! Let me modify this to use a persistent session instead of creating a new one each time:

● Update(src\main\core\core.ts)
  ⎿  Updated src\main\core\core.ts with 20 additions and 13 removals                        
       162        try {
       163          console.log(`Core: Sending prompt: "${text.substring(0, 100)}..."`)
       164    
       165 -        // Create a session for the conversation
       166 -        console.log('Core: Creating session...')
       167 -        const sessionResponse = await this.openCodeClient!.session.create({
       168 -          body: {
       169 -            title: `Chat ${new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}`
       165 +        // Use persistent session or create new one
       166 +        let session: Session
       167 +        if (!this.currentSession) {
       168 +          console.log('Core: Creating new persistent session...')
       169 +          const sessionResponse = await this.openCodeClient!.session.create({
       170 +            body: {
       171 +              title: `Persistent Chat Session - ${new Date().toLocaleString()}`
       172 +            }
       173 +          })
       174 +  
       175 +          // Extract session from response
       176 +          if (!sessionResponse.data?.id) {
       177 +            console.error('Core: Session creation failed:', sessionResponse)
       178 +            throw new Error('Failed to create session - no session ID returned')
       179            }
       180 -        })
       180    
       181 -        // Extract session from response
       182 -        if (!sessionResponse.data?.id) {
       183 -          console.error('Core: Session creation failed:', sessionResponse)
       184 -          throw new Error('Failed to create session - no session ID returned')
       181 +          session = sessionResponse.data
       182 +          this.currentSession = session
       183 +          console.log(`Core: Created new persistent session ${session.id}`)
       184 +        } else {
       185 +          session = this.currentSession
       186 +          console.log(`Core: Using existing persistent session ${session.id}`)
       187          }
       188    
       189 -        const session: Session = sessionResponse.data
       190 -        console.log(`Core: Created session ${session.id}`)
       191 -  
       189          // Send the user message to the session
       190          const promptResponse = await this.openCodeClient!.session.prompt({
       191            path: { id: session.id },

● Now I need to clear the persistent session when there's an error so it gets recreated next time. Let me find the error
  handling section:

● Read(src\main\core\core.ts)
  ⎿  Read 14 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! Let me update the error handling to also clear the persistent session:

● Update(src\main\core\core.ts)
  ⎿  Updated src\main\core\core.ts with 2 additions and 1 removal                                                
       229          return responseText
       230        } catch (error) {
       231          console.error('Core: Prompt failed:', error)
       232 -        // Clear client on error so it gets recreated next time
       232 +        // Clear client and session on error so they get recreated next time
       233          this.openCodeClient = undefined
       234 +        this.currentSession = undefined
       235          throw new Error(`Prompt failed: ${error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error'}`)
       236        }
       237      }

● Now let's modify the process.chdir approach. Instead of changing the Node.js working directory, we should spawn the OpenCode
   binary from the target directory. Let me look at the OpenCode service:

● Read(src\main\services\opencode-service.ts)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● I need to see if the createOpencodeServer function accepts a cwd option or if we need to handle this differently. Looking at
   the search results earlier, it seems the spawn location affects where OpenCode operates. But let me also add an environment
   variable approach. Let me modify this:

● Update(src\main\services\opencode-service.ts)
  ⎿  Updated src\main\services\opencode-service.ts with 9 additions and 5 removals                                        
       214            mkdirSync(workingDirectory, { recursive: true })
       215          }
       216    
       217 -        // Change to the configured working directory before starting OpenCode
       218 -        const originalCwd = process.cwd()
       219 -        console.log('OpenCode Service: Changing from', originalCwd, 'to', workingDirectory)
       220 -        process.chdir(workingDirectory)
       217 +        // Set environment variables to tell OpenCode where to operate
       218 +        const originalCwd = process.env.PWD
       219 +        console.log('OpenCode Service: Setting working directory environment for OpenCode:', workingDirectory)
       220 +        process.env.PWD = workingDirectory
       221 +        process.env.OPENCODE_WORKING_DIR = workingDirectory
       222    
       223          // Check if port is already in use
       224          if (await this.isPortInUse(this.config.port!)) {
     ...
       228            }
       229          }
       230    
       231 +        // Start OpenCode server - it should pick up the working directory from environment
       232          this.server = await createOpencodeServer({
       233            hostname: this.config.hostname,
       234            port: this.config.port,
       235            timeout: this.config.timeout,
       236            config: {
       237 -            model: this.config.model
       237 +            model: this.config.model,
       238 +            // Try to pass working directory in config (may not work)
       239 +            cwd: workingDirectory
       240            }
       241          })
       242    

● Now let's add file operation methods to the Core class. These will be useful for testing and for providing a complete API:

● Update(src\main\core\core.ts)
  ⎿  Updated src\main\core\core.ts with 100 additions                                                                    
       235          throw new Error(`Prompt failed: ${error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error'}`)
       236        }
       237      }
       238 +  
       239 +    // File operation methods using the OpenCode SDK
       240 +    async readFile(filePath: string): Promise<string> {
       241 +      if (!this.openCodeClient) {
       242 +        throw new Error('OpenCode client not initialized')
       243 +      }
       244 +  
       245 +      try {

● Perfect! Now let me add a test call to the file operations after the client is initialized. This will help us debug what's
  happening:

       131          console.error('Core: Project debugging failed:', error)
       132        }

● Perfect! Now let's test our implementation. The key changes we've made should resolve the OpenCode file reading issue:

  Summary of What We Fixed

  1. Created opencode.json in target directory - This tells OpenCode that tojiTest is a project
  2. Implemented persistent sessions - Sessions now maintain context instead of being recreated each time
  3. Added comprehensive debugging - We'll see exactly what project OpenCode thinks it's working with
  4. Enhanced working directory handling - Using environment variables instead of process.chdir()
  5. Added file operation methods - Direct SDK calls to test file access

  What Should Happen Now

  When you run the app and try the chat:

  1. Server startup: You should see environment variable logging
  2. Client initialization: Logs showing current project and all projects
  3. File operations test: Immediate test showing what files OpenCode can see
  4. Persistent sessions: Same session ID used across multiple prompts
  5. File visibility: OpenCode should now see AGENTS.md and opencode.json

  The most telling logs will be:
  - Core: Current project: - Should show the tojiTest directory
  - Core: All files found: - Should include AGENTS.md and opencode.json
  - Core: Using existing persistent session - On subsequent prompts

  Try running the app now and send a prompt like "what files are in this directory" - it should finally see the AGENTS.md file
   that was created earlier!

● Ah! Now I see the issue clearly. The logs reveal exactly what's happening:

  🎯 The Problem: OpenCode is still operating in the wrong project!

  Looking at the logs:
  - ✅ Environment setup: Working directory correctly set to tojiTest
  - ❌ OpenCode project: Still using "C:/Users/donth/toji3" (the app directory)
  - ❌ File operations: Finding 0 files because it's looking in the wrong place

  The Root Cause

  OpenCode has already created a project for the app directory (toji3) and is using that instead of detecting the new tojiTest
   directory. Notice the project data:

  {
    "worktree": "C:/Users/donth/toji3",  // ← Wrong directory!
    "vcs": "git"
  }

  OpenCode is prioritizing the existing Git repository (toji3) over our target directory (tojiTest).

  The Solution

  We need to explicitly create or switch to a project for the tojiTest directory. Let me add logic to handle this:

● Update(src\main\core\core.ts)
  ⎿  Updated src\main\core\core.ts with 10 additions                                                                 
       124          const allProjects = await this.openCodeClient.project.list()
       125          console.log('Core: All projects:', JSON.stringify(allProjects, null, 2))
       126    
       127 +        // Check if we need to create or switch to the correct project
       128 +        const targetDirectory = this.config.getOpencodeWorkingDirectory()
       129 +        console.log('Core: Target directory:', targetDirectory)
       130 +  
       131 +        if (!currentProject.data || currentProject.data.worktree !== targetDirectory) {
       132 +          console.log('Core: Current project is not the target directory, need to switch/create project')
       133 +          // For now, we'll work with what we have but log the issue
       134 +          console.warn(`Core: OpenCode is using project in ${currentProject.data?.worktree} instead of 
           + ${targetDirectory}`)
       135 +        }
       136 +  
       137          // Test file operations to see what OpenCode can access
       138          console.log('Core: Testing file operations immediately after client init...')
       139          await this.testFileOperations()

● The real solution is that we need to start the OpenCode server from the target directory, not just set environment
  variables. Let me fix the service to actually spawn the server in the correct location:

● Update(src\main\services\opencode-service.ts)
  ⎿  Updated src\main\services\opencode-service.ts with 23 additions and 11 removals                                      
       214            mkdirSync(workingDirectory, { recursive: true })
       215          }

  Expected Changes in the Logs

  1. Directory change logging:
  OpenCode Service: Changing process working directory from C:\Users\donth\toji3 to C:\Users\donth\OneDrive\Desktop\tojiTest
  2. Correct project detection:
  "worktree": "C:/Users/donth/OneDrive/Desktop/tojiTest"
  2. (Instead of the current wrong path)
  3. File operations finding files:
  Core: Found 2 files matching *
  Core: All files found: ["AGENTS.md", "opencode.json"]
  4. Text search working:
  Core: Found 1 text matches for clown

  Key Fix Summary

  The issue was that OpenCode's project detection happens when the server starts, and it uses the process's current working
  directory to determine what project to work with. By changing the process directory BEFORE calling createOpencodeServer(),
  OpenCode will now:

  1. Detect the correct project (tojiTest directory)
  2. See the opencode.json we created
  3. Operate in the right context for all file operations
  4. Maintain persistent sessions in the correct project

  Try restarting the app now - the project context should finally be correct, and when you ask "what files are in this
  directory", it should see AGENTS.md!

> Ok that seems to be working but does that mean that every time we want to switch projects we need to spawn the process in that
   folder? We should get some resolution on this

● You're absolutely right to question this approach! Let me research how OpenCode actually handles project switching and what
  the proper solution should be.

● Web Search("opencode SDK switch project change directory runtime session context")

● Let me check issue #841 about session directory locking:

     │ Yes, you're correct - the current approach requires spawning the OpenCode server in each target directory, which is not  │

  This is absolutely fine. And not unexpected. My only question is, if we're spawning the binary per workspace, then what is the
   point of having project objects? How does opencode justify having the object? The user just doesn't understand how opencode 
  SDK is INTENDED to work

● Excellent question! You're right to be confused - the existence of project objects in the SDK when the server is locked to a
   single directory seems contradictory. Let me research how OpenCode actually intends these project objects to be used.

● Web Search("opencode multiple projects workspace monorepo "project.list" "project.current" site:github.com")
  ⎿  Did 2 searches in 27s                                                                                                   

● Let me search more specifically for OpenCode's project concept:

● Web Search(""opencode" "project" "worktree" multiple directories subprojects")
  ⎿  Did 1 search in 36s                                                                                                     

● Now I understand better! Let me look at the actual OpenCode source to understand what "projects" really mean:

● Web Search("site:github.com/sst/opencode "project" API endpoint server implementation")
  ⎿  Did 1 search in 22s                                                                                                     

● Let me check what we're actually getting from the project API in our logs:

● Search(pattern: "worktree.*toji3|global.*worktree|project.*id.*82b7e977", path: "~\toji3", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 5 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now I understand! Looking at our logs, we have two projects:

  1. Project with ID 82b7e9779572746b1d6ef01ca21c13952cf48bb1:
    - "worktree": "C:/Users/donth/toji3"
    - "vcs": "git"
    - This is a Git repository project
  2. Project with ID "global":
    - "worktree": "/"
    - No VCS
    - This appears to be a fallback/global project

  The Answer to Your Question

  Why does OpenCode have project objects when it's locked to one directory?

  The "projects" in OpenCode aren't for switching between different codebases at runtime. Instead, they represent:

  1. Session Organization: Projects group sessions by worktree location. When you run OpenCode in different directories over
  time, it creates different project entries to organize your session history.
  2. Git Worktree Support: The real use case is for Git worktrees - multiple working directories of the SAME repository:
    - myproject/main (main branch worktree)
    - myproject/feature-a (feature branch worktree)
    - myproject/bugfix (bugfix branch worktree)

  These would all be separate "projects" in OpenCode, but they're all the same codebase.
  3. Session History Management: The project.list() API lets you see all the places you've run OpenCode before. The "global"
  project is likely for operations outside any specific project directory.
  4. Future Feature Support: As seen in issue #1877, OpenCode plans to support "root folder" configuration where multiple
  worktrees would aggregate under one project.

  The Key Insight

  OpenCode "projects" are NOT for switching between different codebases dynamically. They are for:
  - Tracking WHERE you've run OpenCode sessions
  - Organizing session history by location
  - Supporting Git worktrees (multiple checkouts of same repo)
  - Future features like session aggregation

  The server is indeed locked to one directory per instance, and that's by design. The project objects are metadata about
  session locations, not a mechanism for runtime directory switching.

  This explains why we see both toji3 and global projects - they're just historical records of where OpenCode has been run,
  not active switching contexts.

> Ohhh ok the user was confused about that. Ok that's perfectly fine and not at all unexpected. Thought we would get lucky with 
  workspace management but we can just buidl that in later. For now though, answer me this. Why do we need readFile, searchText 
  etc.. what do they do for us?

● Great question! Let me explain why we added those file operation methods (readFile, searchText, findFiles) and what they
  actually do for us:

  Why We Added These Methods

  Initially, we added them thinking they would help debug why OpenCode couldn't see files. But now that we understand the
  architecture better, let's reconsider their actual value:

  What They Actually Do

  1. readFile(path) - Calls OpenCode's file.read() API to read a file through the AI agent's context
  2. findFiles(pattern) - Calls OpenCode's find.files() API to search for files by pattern
  3. searchText(term) - Calls OpenCode's find.text() API to search for text within files

  The Key Question: Why Use These?

  These methods let OpenCode's AI agent understand your codebase, but they're NOT for your app to read files directly. Here's
  the distinction:

  ❌ What They're NOT For:

  - Your Electron app reading its own config files
  - Your app accessing user data
  - General file I/O operations
  - Your app should use Node.js fs module for these

  ✅ What They ARE For:

  - Giving the AI context about the project it's helping with
  - Letting the AI search for code patterns before making suggestions
  - Allowing the AI to read files to understand what it's working on
  - Enabling AI-powered code navigation and understanding

  Real Use Case Example

  Imagine a user asks the AI: "Help me refactor the authentication system"

  The AI needs to:
  1. findFiles('**/auth*.ts') - Find all auth-related files
  2. readFile('src/auth/login.ts') - Read the current implementation
  3. searchText('authenticate') - Find all uses of authentication
  4. Then provide informed suggestions based on the actual code

  Do We Actually Need Them?

  For basic chat: No, the prompt() method is enough
  For AI that understands code context: Yes, these are essential

  The AI agent already has internal access to these operations when processing prompts, but exposing them through our Core API
   allows us to:
  - Pre-fetch context before sending prompts
  - Build smarter UI features (like "analyze current file")
  - Create context-aware workflows

  The Bottom Line

  These methods are about giving the AI agent visibility into the codebase it's helping with, not about general file
  operations for your app. If you just want chat functionality, you can remove them. If you want the AI to understand and work
   with code, they're valuable tools for building that context.

  They're essentially programmatic access to what the AI agent can already do internally when responding to prompts like "what
   files are in this directory?"

> Shouldnt the server/agent be able to do this automatically? Why does it need our codebase?

● You're absolutely right! The OpenCode agent already has these capabilities built-in and can use them automatically when
  responding to prompts. We don't need to expose these methods at all!

  The Reality Check

  When a user sends a prompt like "refactor the auth system", the OpenCode agent:
  - Automatically searches for relevant files
  - Automatically reads the code it needs
  - Automatically understands the context
  - Automatically generates appropriate responses

  We don't need to manually call readFile() or searchText() for the agent to do its job!

  So Why Did We Add Them?

  We added them for debugging - to test if OpenCode could see files in the directory. But for normal operation, they're
  completely unnecessary.

  What the Agent Actually Needs from Our Codebase

  Nothing! The agent operates independently. Our Core class only needs to:

  1. Start the OpenCode server in the right directory
  2. Create/manage sessions
  3. Send prompts and receive responses

  That's it! The agent handles all file operations internally based on the prompts it receives.

  The Methods We Added Are Redundant

  - readFile() - Agent can already read files when needed
  - findFiles() - Agent can already search for files
  - searchText() - Agent can already search text
  - testFileOperations() - Just for debugging, not needed in production

  The Clean Architecture

  Our Core class should just be:
  class Core {
    // Start service
    // Create session  
    // Send prompt
    // Get response
  }

  The OpenCode agent has full access to the filesystem (within its working directory) and doesn't need us to spoon-feed it
  file contents. It's designed to explore and understand the codebase on its own!

  Bottom line: Those file operation methods are unnecessary overhead. The agent is self-sufficient and will use its own file
  operations as needed to answer prompts. We were over-engineering it!

> Ok lets clean up then yea? We are going to refactor a bit after this session so lets just focus on cleanup for now
                                                                                                                             
●User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿  Cleanup Plan: Remove Unnecessary File Operations

     You're absolutely right - let's clean up the over-engineered parts! Here's what we'll remove:

     Files to Clean Up

     Core class (src/main/core/core.ts):
     - Remove readFile() method - unnecessary
     - Remove findFiles() method - unnecessary  
     - Remove searchText() method - unnecessary
     - Remove testFileOperations() method - was just for debugging
     - Remove the file operations test call from initializeOpenCodeClient()
     - Keep only the essential project debugging logs (those are actually useful)

     OpenCode Service (src/main/services/opencode-service.ts):
     - Keep the working directory management (that's the core fix)
     - Keep the proper cleanup in stop() method
     - Remove any unused variables if any

     What We'll Keep

     The core fixes that actually matter:
     - ✅ Persistent session management (prevents session recreation)
     - ✅ Working directory management (ensures correct project context)
     - ✅ Project debugging logs (helps verify correct setup)
     - ✅ opencode.json in target directory (project identification)
     - ✅ Environment variable setup (additional guidance for OpenCode)

     What We'll Remove

     The over-engineered parts:
     - ❌ All manual file operation methods
     - ❌ File operations testing
     - ❌ Redundant API calls that duplicate what the agent does automatically

     Result

     A clean, minimal Core class that:
     1. Starts OpenCode in the right directory
     2. Manages persistent sessions
     3. Sends prompts and gets responses
     4. Lets the OpenCode agent handle all file operations internally

     This removes ~100 lines of unnecessary code and keeps only the essential functionality that actually fixes the original 
     problem!

● Let's start by removing the unnecessary file operation methods from the Core class:

● Read(src\main\core\core.ts)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! I can see the file operation methods starting at line 253. Let me remove all of them at once:

● Update(src\main\core\core.ts)
  ⎿  Error editing file

● Let me read more of the file to see the exact content:

● Read(src\main\core\core.ts)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● I need to see the end of the file to get the complete methods. Let me read the rest:

● Read(src\main\core\core.ts)
  ⎿  Read 5 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! Now I can remove all the file operation methods from line 253 to line 351:

● Excellent! Now I need to remove the call to testFileOperations() from the initialization. Let me find where it's called:

● Search(pattern: "testFileOperations", path: "src\main\core\core.ts", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 5 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! Let me remove that call:

● Update(src\main\core\core.ts)
  ⎿  Updated src\main\core\core.ts with 3 removals                                                                 
       134            console.warn(`Core: OpenCode is using project in ${currentProject.data?.worktree} instead of 
             ${targetDirectory}`)
       135          }
       136    
       137 -        // Test file operations to see what OpenCode can access
       138 -        console.log('Core: Testing file operations immediately after client init...')
       139 -        await this.testFileOperations()
       137        } catch (error) {
       138          console.error('Core: Project debugging failed:', error)
       139        }

● Now let me check what imports we have and see if any are no longer needed:

● Read(src\main\core\core.ts)
  ⎿  Read 10 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Let me check if we're still using the Part type anywhere since we removed the file operations:

● Search(pattern: "Part", path: "src\main\core\core.ts", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 6 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Good! We're still using the Part type in the prompt response parsing, so we need to keep that import. Let me check if there
  are any unused variables:

● Bash(npm run typecheck:node)
  ⎿  > toji3@1.0.0 typecheck:node                          
     > tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.node.json --composite false

● Great! No TypeScript errors. Now let's test that the essential functionality still works by building:

● Bash(npm run build)
  ⎿  > toji3@1.0.0 build                       
     > npm run typecheck && electron-vite build
     … +33 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! The build succeeded and I notice the bundle size went down slightly (from 640.53 kB to 637.19 kB), confirming we
  removed code successfully.

● Excellent! Let's commit our cleanup:

● Bash(git add -A && git status)
  ⎿  On branch master                                   
     Changes to be committed:
       (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
     … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Bash(git commit -m "refactor: remove unnecessary file operation methods from Core class…)
  ⎿  [master e61741a] refactor: remove unnecessary file operation methods from Core class
      1 file changed, 102 deletions(-)

● Perfect! 🎉

  Cleanup Complete!

  We successfully cleaned up the over-engineered parts of the codebase:

  ✅ What We Removed

  - 102 lines of unnecessary code (readFile, findFiles, searchText, testFileOperations)
  - Redundant file operations that the OpenCode agent handles automatically
  - Debug testing code that was only needed during development

  ✅ What We Kept (The Essential Parts)

  - Persistent session management - Prevents recreating sessions
  - Working directory management - Ensures correct project context
  - Core prompt/response handling - The actual communication with OpenCode
  - Project debugging logs - Helpful for verifying setup

  ✅ Result

  - Cleaner architecture - Core class focuses on its actual responsibilities
  - Smaller bundle - Reduced from 640.53 kB to 637.19 kB
  - Better separation of concerns - Let OpenCode agent handle file ops
  - More maintainable - Less code to debug and maintain

  The Core class is now lean and focused on what it should actually do: manage the OpenCode SDK connection, handle sessions,
  and communicate with the agent. The OpenCode agent will automatically handle all file operations based on user prompts - no
  need for us to manually orchestrate that!

  Ready for your refactor! 🚀
